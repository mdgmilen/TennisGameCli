Study programming and play tennis in terminal /console.

Business requirements follow...

Your task is to implement a console application
which can count the points and show the actual
standings of a tennis match.

After each point played, the user wants to enter the player who scored, and the
application will print out the new standings of the match.
If one player wins, the application will celebrate the winner and the execution finishes.
